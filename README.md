A proof-of-concept phone app for the kiss-light hub.

Right now it is extremely basic in terms of functionality, and the approach I have taken can be completely
wrong.

How to use App (as of 03-22-2021): After specifying the Server and connecting, it will list
devices on the hub. Select a desired device and the toggle button will toggle the device's power state.
